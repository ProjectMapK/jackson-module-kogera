jackson-module-kogera
====
`jackson-module-kogera` is an experimental project to develop `jackson-module-kotlin`.  
This project has the following features compared to `jackson-module-kotlin`.

- Lightweight
- high-performance
  - Fast deserialization
  - Smaller memory consumption
- More `Kotlin` friendly behavior

Especially when it comes to deserialization throughput, it is several times higher than `jackson-module-kotlin`.

This project is experimental, but passes all the tests implemented in `jackson-module-kotlin` except for the intentional incompatibility.

# Features of `jackson-module-kogera`
The main feature of `jackson-module-kogera` is that it replaces `kotlin-reflect` with `kotlinx.metadata.jvm`.  
As of `1.7.21`, `kotlin-reflect` is a huge library(3MB), and replacing it with `kotlinx.metadata.jvm`(1MB) makes it lightweight.

Several performance improvements have also been made.
First, by implementing the equivalent of https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/pull/439, deserialization is now up to three times faster, depending on the use case.  
The cache has also been reorganized based on [benchmark results](https://github.com/ProjectMapK/kogera-benchmark) to achieve smaller memory consumption.  
The performance degradation when the `strictNullChecks` option is enabled is also [greatly reduced](https://github.com/ProjectMapK/jackson-module-kogera/pull/44).

The next main feature is `value class` support.  
The `jackson-module-kogera` supports many use cases for `value class`, including deserialization.  
See [here](./docs/AboutValueClassSupport.md) for basic policies and notes on handling `value class`.

[Here](./docs/FixedIssues.md) is a list of issues that are not resolved in `jackson-module-kotlin` but are or will be resolved in `kogera`.

## About intentional destructive changes
This project makes several disruptive changes to achieve more `Kotlin-like` behavior.  
Details are summarized in [KogeraSpecificImplementations](./docs/KogeraSpecificImplementations.md).

# Compatibility
- `jackson 2.15.0`
- `Java 8+`
- `Kotlin 1.7.21+`

## About compatibility checks
Compatibility checks for `Java` and `Kotlin` are done by `CI` grid tests.

The `Java` test covers all currently supported LTS versions and the latest versions.  
Currently 8,11,17 and 19 are covered.

`Kotlin` is tested on the latest patch version and the latest `Beta` or `RC` version within each minor version since 1.7.21.  
Currently 1.7.21 and 1.8.21 are covered.  
I hope to lower this version in the future, but currently the minimum `Kotlin` version that can be supported is 1.7 due to `kotlinx-metadata-jvm` constraints.

# Installation
The package is temporarily published in `JitPack`.  
Please refer to `jitpack.io` for the released version.

[ProjectMapK / jackson\-module\-kogera](https://jitpack.io/#ProjectMapK/jackson-module-kogera)

```kotlin
repositories {
    // ...

    maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }
}

dependencies {
  // ...

  implementation("com.github.ProjectMapK:jackson-module-kogera:${version}")
}
```

## Migration in existing projects
When replacing `jackson-module-kotlin` in an existing project, please follow these steps

1. Replace the dependencies of `jackson-module-kotlin` with `jackson-module-kogera`.
2. Replace `com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin` used for `import` with `io.github.projectmapk.jackson.module.kogera`.

In projects that use `spring-boot`, there is a possibility that `jackson-module-kotlin` will be used by auto-configuration.  
Therefore, it is necessary to exclude `jackson-module-kotlin` from the dependencies and to configure it manually.

You can check if your project's dependencies include `jackson-module-kotlin` by looking at `. /gradlew dependencies`.

If you find any problems, it would be appreciated if you could share them in an `issue`.

# About the future
Currently, this project is in `beta`.  
I intend to develop the following

- Migration to more efficient reflection cache.
- Resolve as many known bugs related to `value class` as possible.
- Fixing other bugs.

# About license
This project is based on `jackson-module-kotlin`, so the license follows `jackson-module-kotlin`.
